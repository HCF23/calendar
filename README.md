Create a routine that will generate a text calendar for any year. Test the calendar by generating a calendar for the year 1969, on a device of the time. Choose one of the following devices:

    A line printer with a width of 132 characters.
    An IBM 3278 model 4 terminal (80×43 display with accented characters). Target formatting the months of the year to fit nicely across the 80 character width screen. Restrict number of lines in test output to 43.


(Ideally, the program will generate well-formatted calendars for any page width from 20 characters up.)

Kudos (κῦδος) for routines that also transition from Julian to Gregorian calendar.

This task is inspired by Real Programmers Don't Use PASCAL by Ed Post, Datamation, volume 29 number 7, July 1983.
